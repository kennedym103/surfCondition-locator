# SURF SPOT LOCATOR

This application was created to solve the issue of driving all over the place to find good surf. Lots of time and gas wasted...

This application takes the users geolocation and then calculates the distance in lattitude and longitude from their current location to the closest surf spots. It then takes those surf spots and evaluates the quality of the surf regarding swell height, swell direction, wind speed, and wind direction specific to that spots bathymetry and orientation on the coast. It then list the spots closest to you from best to worst quality surf and allows you to navigate to them.
